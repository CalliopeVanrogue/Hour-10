{
//I felt the game was too hard but also too easy. By that I mean I found it almost impossible to actually hit the balls but after about 3 minutes the balls themselves managed to eventually go into the goals so I won the game regardless
// Adjusting the player speed might help. Perhaps being able to rotate the bumper might work as well.
// Making the balls different sizes would make it a bit more appealing and fun to navigate. I think that it would also be pretty cool if the balls and the bumper moved more than horizontally like maybe they flew around and so did you as a player
//Personally I didn't find the game fun at all. I was not able to really hit the balls at all and the game just kind of solved itself. Running around was pretty tedious honestly

//To change the game I changed the shape and speed of the bumper
//My second change was to make the bumper a bit more complex by changing the shape of the bumper
//My third change was adding variations of the chaos balls. I added more as well as different sizes so it's slightly more chaotic
//The fourth and final change and my favorite is I added pillars to the scene that have the bouncy material assigned as well to make it even harder to win the game
